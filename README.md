# Movie Recommendation App

This repository contains a Python-based application for movie recommendations using semantic search powered by Sentence Transformers. The app allows users to input a descriptive query (like "heartfelt romantic comedy") and get movie suggestions that best match their criteria. Filters for IMDb scores and vote counts are also included to refine the results.
